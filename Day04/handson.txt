1. multi-cluster deployment.


gitops is the modern way of implementing continuous deployment.

let say i have 5 clusters(enivornment) dev,prod,uat,qa,stagging..all are using v1..

now i want to update only dev,stagging, qa..to v2 
how to update only those cluster


using argocd we will devlop into 3 clusters

we will install argocd in one of the cluster -- from these cluster we will
deploy the changes into multi-cluster

this is hub-spoke model

in the legacy platform - we can't keep track the changes..
will not able to capable of keep track any maual changes..


standalone - for every cluster..we have argocd controller..
if we are doing any upgrades..it will be hard..

hubspoke - we have centralized argocd controller with we can connect
to the multi cluster and deploy the changes
we need to set this as high availability...
or load will be huge
