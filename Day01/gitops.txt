Gitops

Gitops uses git as a single source of truth to deliver application and infrastructure

* Argocd controller keep track the Yaml manifests in the github, whenever a change happens
in the yaml manifests it will take those changes deploy into kubernetes cluster.
* Let say if some is login into one of the pod and deleting, argocd will override
those changes and whatever the configurations in the github it will bring back.
* Argocd controller always make sure the desired state is always there in kubernetes controller.

* with these we  have security, versioning(keep track changes), auto healing if something went wrong and
continous reconciliation
